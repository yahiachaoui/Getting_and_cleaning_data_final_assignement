Subjects that performed the experiment are labeled from 1 to 30. 
The features selected for this database come from accelerometer and gyroscope 3-axial raw signals. 
These time domain signals were captured at a constant rate of 50 Hz. 
Then they were filtered using a median filter and a 3rd order low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 20 Hz to remove noise. 
Similarly, the acceleration signal was then separated into body and gravity acceleration signals using another low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 0.3 Hz. 
Subsequently, the body linear acceleration and angular velocity were derived in time to obtain Jerk signals. 
Also the magnitude of these three-dimensional signals were calculated using the Euclidean norm. 
Finally a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) was applied to some of these signals. They are therefore within the frequency domain.
These signals were used to estimate variables of the feature vector for each pattern in the X, Y and Z directions.
